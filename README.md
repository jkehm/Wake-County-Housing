## Housing Market in Wake County
#### Communication Protocols
* **Regular check-ins:** Schedule regular check-ins to discuss the progress of the project and any issues that have arisen. This will mostly be done through Slack.
* **Task allocation:** Assign specific tasks to each team member and set deadlines for completion.
* **Clear communication channels:** Use clear and direct communication channels to avoid any misunderstandings. Email, chat, and video conferencing can all be used depending on the nature of the communication. For voice/video calls we will utilize a Meeting Notes Google Doc that will serve as a living document throughout the projects life. 
* **Document sharing:** Use cloud-based document sharing tools like Google Drive and GitHub to share documents and files related to the project. This will ensure that everyone has access to the latest version of the files.
* **Version control:** Use version control tools like Git to track changes to code and data files. This will help prevent errors and ensure that everyone is working with the latest version of the files.
* **Respectful communication:** Ensure that all team members communicate respectfully and professionally at all times. This will help maintain a positive and productive team environment.
* *Conflict resolution:** Have a process in place for resolving conflicts that may arise during the project.
